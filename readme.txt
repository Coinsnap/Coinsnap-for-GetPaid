Accept Bitcoin payments with Coinsnap for GetPaid!

== Description ==

Enable your visitors to make purchases or subscriptions with Bitcoin using GetPaid by adding Bitcoin payment to the over payment methods that are available with GetPaid with this simple-to-install plugon.

With the Coinsnap Bitcoin payment plugin for GetPaid you only need a Lightning wallet with a Lightning address, a Coinsnap account, and a minute to set up GetPaid to accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your WordPress website.

With this plugin you can then accept Bitcoin for all kinds of payments transacted thourgh GetPaid – you need no shop system, no other payment provider or anything else to accept Bitcoin with GetPaid. 

Coinsnap’s Bitcoin payment plugin for GetPaid makes it amazingly simple for your customers to donate or contribute with Bitcoin-Lightning: They can make their transactions with just a scan of the QR code generated by the Coinsnap for GetPaid plugin, and their authorization of the payment. When authorized, the payment will be credited directly and immediately to your Lightning wallet.
