Open GetPaid in the left menu bar and click on Settings.

Under Settings we find the Payment Gateways item in the top menu bar and below it the list of all GetPaid payment gateways and now also Coinsnap.

We click on Manage and can only make the individual settings.

First we need the store ID and the API key from Coinsnap. To do this, we log in to Coinsnap and go to the Setting section.

If you don’t have a Coinsnap account yet, you can create one [here](https://app.coinsnap.io/register)

All you need is an email address and a Lightning Wallet with a Lightning address. You can find out how to create a Coinsnap account under [Getting started](https://coinsnap.io/en/getting-started/).

In the Store Settings sub-item, we find the Store ID and API Key details. We need this information because both details must be stored with GetPaid.
