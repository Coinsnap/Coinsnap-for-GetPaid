With the Coinsnap Bitcoin payment plugin for GetPaid you only need a Lightning wallet with a Lightning address, a Coinsnap account, and a minute to set up GetPaid to accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your WordPress website.

With this plugin you can then accept Bitcoin for all kinds of payments transacted thourgh GetPaid – you need no shop system, no other payment provider or anything else to accept Bitcoin with GetPaid.

When authorized, the payment will be credited directly and immediately to your Lightning wallet.
